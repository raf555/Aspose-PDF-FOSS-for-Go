[![Aspose.PDF FOSS for Go](https://products.aspose.org/media/pdf/go/banner-readme.png)](https://products.aspose.org/pdf/go/)

A pure Go PDF library — no CGo, no native libraries, no third-party package dependencies
(standard library only), MIT-licensed. It creates, edits, renders, signs, encrypts, converts, and
validates PDF documents: split/merge/extract pages, extract and search text, fill and build
AcroForms, draw text/vector graphics/tables, embed and subset fonts, apply digital signatures
(PKCS#7, PAdES, timestamps), validate and convert PDF/A, author accessible Tagged PDF, and
render pages to images with a built-in rasterizer that has no third-party package dependencies of
its own, convert to and from Markdown, HTML, and SVG, and query documents through a set of AI
copilots over any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The API shape mirrors Aspose.PDF for .NET where natural, so concepts transfer directly for
developers coming from that library, and spec references throughout follow ISO 32000-1 (PDF 1.7)
and ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0). This project is not to be confused with `aspose-pdf-go-cpp` (a CGo
wrapper around a native library) — it is 100% Go source, `go get` and cross-compile anywhere.

## Key Capabilities

- **Page-level operations and metadata** — `Document.Split()` breaks a document into per-page
  documents; `Extract` builds a new document from selected `PageRange`s without touching the
  source; `Append` combines multiple PDFs into one by merging another document's pages in place;
  `Rotate`/`SetRotation` turn pages, and `Reorder` rearranges them by an explicit 1-based index
  slice (repeats and omissions both allowed); `Document.NUp`/`Document.Booklet` (`NUp`/`Booklet`)
  impose pages onto larger sheets for N-up printing or saddle-stitch binding, each returning a new
  document built from Form XObjects and leaving the source untouched; and blank PDFs can be
  created from scratch with `NewDocument`/`NewDocumentFromFormat`. Each `*Page` exposes its own
  `Number()`, `Size()` (a `PageSize{Width, Height}` in points), and `Rotation()` getters, and page
  geometry (`MediaBox`/`CropBox`/`TrimBox`/`BleedBox`/`ArtBox`) is readable and, via
  `SetMediaBox`/`SetCropBox`/`SetTrimBox`/`SetBleedBox`/`SetArtBox` (plus the `SetPageSize`
  shorthand for resizing the MediaBox), writable without scaling existing content; the `/Info`
  dictionary round-trips through `Document.Info()`/`SetInfo()`/`ClearInfo()` and a `DocumentInfo`
  struct, distinct from the XMP metadata packet available via
  `Document.XMP()`/`SetXMP()`/`ClearXMP()` (backed by the `/Catalog/Metadata` stream, with a raw
  `XMPRaw()`/`SetXMPRaw()` escape hatch and `SyncInfoToXMP()` to mirror `/Info` into XMP); and the
  `/PageLabels` numbering tree is written with `Document.SetPageLabels` (roman/decimal/alphabetic
  styles, prefix, and start value per range) and read back per-page via `Page.Label()`.
- **Encryption and digital signatures** — `Document.SetPassword(userPassword, ownerPassword)`
  password-protects the document on save with AES-128 (`/CFM /AESV2`), AES-256 (`/CFM /AESV3`,
  bumps the file to PDF 2.0), or RC4-128 and granular viewer permissions (print, copy, modify,
  annotate, fill, accessibility, assemble); sign with a PKCS#7-detached signature
  (SHA-256, RSA or ECDSA) that can be PAdES, a DocMDP certification, and/or carry an RFC 3161
  trusted timestamp, over plain or already-encrypted documents, with support for multiple
  incremental signatures and verification via `VerifySignatures` — optionally asking the issuer
  whether the signing certificate was revoked (OCSP or CRL, network opt-in through
  `ValidationOptions`) and embedding that evidence as a `/DSS` with `AddValidationInfo`, so the
  signature still verifies after the certificate expires (LTV). Keys are passed as a standard
  `crypto.Signer` plus `*x509.Certificate` — no `.p12` file required. Documents can also be
  encrypted for **certificate recipients** instead of a password
  (`EncryptionOptions.Recipients`, the `/Adobe.PubSec` handler): each recipient gets its own
  permissions, and the file opens with `OpenWithCertificate(path, cert, key)` for any
  `crypto.Decrypter`.
- **Content authoring with the Flow layout engine** — `Document.NewFlow` lays out paragraphs,
  headings, images, tables, and lists top-to-bottom with automatic pagination; floating boxes
  (absolute, in-flow, or floated with text wrap-around) and multi-column layout are built on the
  same engine; `FlowOptions.Tagged` auto-tags every element for a one-call PDF/UA-conformant
  document.
- **Tables and vector graphics** — `pdf.NewTable()` builds multi-page tables with repeating
  header rows (auto-fit or explicit `Row.SetHeight`), cell merging via
  `Cell.SetColSpan`/`SetRowSpan`, per-cell styling, and image cells via `Cell.SetImage`, rendered
  onto a page with `(*Page).AddTable(t, rect)`; `(*Page).DrawLine`/`DrawRectangle`/`DrawCircle`/
  `DrawPath` and friends draw first-class vector content directly on a page, and a `Path` fluent
  builder (`MoveTo`/`LineTo`/`CurveTo`/`QuadTo`/`Arc`/`Close`) covers arbitrary shapes; fills
  support solid colours, `ShapeStyle.FillGradient` (linear or radial), and
  `Document.CreateTilingPattern(w, h)` repeating-motif tiling patterns.
- **AcroForms** — read, and build from scratch every standard field type with
  `AddTextField`/`AddCheckbox`/`AddRadioGroup`/`AddComboBox`/`AddListBox`/`AddPushButton` (plus
  the typed password/file-select/rich-text/number/date variants — behavior flags exposed as `/Ff`
  on the underlying field dictionary) and remove one with `RemoveField`; `AddBarcodeField` draws
  Code128 or QR symbols in place of text, encoded by this library's own pure-Go encoders (no
  external dependency); `Field.SetStyle`/`Style()` control widget appearance (border, background, font),
  and `(*ButtonField).SetAppearance` gives push buttons distinct normal/rollover/down captions
  and an icon; field values round-trip as typed JSON, FDF, and XFDF for template-fill and
  Acrobat-interoperable data interchange.
- **Annotations, bookmarks, and redaction** — the full ISO 32000-1 markup/drawing annotation
  family with auto-regenerated appearance streams, hierarchical outlines (`OutlineItemCollection`)
  and named destinations with all 8 PDF destination types, and mark-then-apply redaction that
  irreversibly removes text, images, and paths from the marked regions. `Document.Flatten()`/
  `Form.Flatten()` bake interactive fields and annotations into static page content so the
  result renders identically but is no longer editable.
- **Attachments and portfolios** — `Document.EmbeddedFiles()` attaches, reads back, and removes
  document-level files through the `/Catalog/Names/EmbeddedFiles` name tree, while
  `Document.Collection()` turns those attachments into a **PDF portfolio**: a schema of custom
  columns (`Schema().Add("Amount", "Total", CollectionFieldNumber)`), per-file values via
  `EmbeddedFile.CollectionItem()`, an initial file, a sort order, and a details/tiles/hidden
  presentation mode — so viewers show a navigable table instead of a plain attachment list, and
  the cover page still opens anywhere.
- **Tagged PDF and PDF/UA accessibility** — `Document.TaggedContent()` builds a logical structure
  tree as content is drawn (`TagContent`, `AddTaggedTable`, `AddTaggedList`), and
  `Document.ValidatePDFUA()` reports the PDF/UA-1 prerequisites still missing.
- **PDF/A and structural validation** — `Validate` checks structural integrity;
  `ValidatePDFA(PDFA1B/2B/3B/1A/2A/3A)` reports archival-conformance violations; `ConvertToPDFA`
  moves a document toward conformance in one call (strips encryption/JavaScript, embeds
  non-embedded Standard-14 fonts, adds an sRGB ICC OutputIntent, writes the `pdfaid` XMP packet).
- **E-invoices (ZUGFeRD / Factur-X)** — `Document.AttachInvoice(xml)` turns a document into a hybrid
  e-invoice: the CII XML is embedded as `factur-x.xml` with the associated-file relationship its
  profile calls for, the Factur-X metadata and extension schema are written, and the document is
  converted to PDF/A-3. `Document.Invoice()` extracts the invoice from incoming Factur-X and ZUGFeRD
  2.x/1.0 files together with its profile. Attachments also gain PDF/A-3 associated-file
  relationships (`EmbeddedFile.SetAFRelationship`).
- **Rendering to raster images** — a pure-Go anti-aliased renderer with no third-party package
  dependencies of its own (its own rasterizer — no `golang.org/x/image`, no cgo) draws vector
  graphics, images (including CCITT fax, JBIG2, and JPEG2000 (`/JPXDecode`) scans), and text
  (embedded and non-embedded via a `FontRepository` covering `.ttc`/`.otf` faces, including
  non-embedded CJK) to PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, and single- or multi-page
  TIFF via `Page.RenderImage`/`RenderPNG`/`RenderTIFF`/… and `Document.RenderTIFF`.
- **HTML, SVG, and Markdown conversion** — `SaveHTML` exports a single-file HTML document with no
  external assets in four modes (faithful raster, visible text, native SVG-per-page, and
  reflowable), including fillable AcroForm controls; in text/native modes, embedded TrueType/
  OpenType fonts are re-wrapped as WOFF `@font-face` data URLs with a browser cmap synthesized
  from the font's `/ToUnicode` mapping, so text renders in the document's real faces. `SaveSVG`
  exports standalone true-vector SVG pages with all binary parts embedded as `data:` URLs by
  default, or externalized via `ResourceWriter`, and `AddSVG` imports SVG 1.1 content (shapes,
  gradients, clipping, masks) back onto a page; `MarkdownToDocument` renders CommonMark + GFM as a
  paginated PDF (652/652 on the official test suite), `Flow.AddMarkdown` mixes Markdown into a
  Flow document, `Page.AddMarkdown(md, rect)` draws it into a `Rectangle` on an existing page, and
  `SaveMarkdown` re-assembles a PDF as GFM Markdown.
- **Stamps and watermarks** — `Document.AddTextWatermark`/`AddSVGWatermark` overlay a text or SVG
  watermark across selected pages (or every page); `(*Page).AddStamp`/`(*Document).AddStamp` place
  a `TextStamp`, `ImageStamp`, or `PageNumberStamp` on one or more pages.
- **Table detection and Office/eBook conversion** — `TableAbsorber` (`Visit(page)` then
  `TableList()`) recognizes ruled and borderless tables directly from a page's vector geometry (no
  rasterization), with conservative guards so ordinary prose, lists, TOCs, and code listings are
  never mistaken for tables. This feeds `Document.SaveDocx`/`WriteDocx` (a pure-stdlib OOXML
  writer producing styled runs, heading styles, hyperlinks, and lists, plus real Word tables —
  `EnhancedFlow`, the default mode — from detected table structure), `Document.SaveXlsx`/
  `WriteXlsx` (detected tables become Excel worksheets with real numeric cells, merged cells, and
  header shading, or a full-page cell-per-line mode), and `Document.SaveEpub`/`WriteEpub` (a
  reflowable, spec-correct OCF-container EPUB 3 book with chapters split at headings and a real
  navigation TOC).
- **Document comparison** — `CompareDocumentsPageByPage` and `CompareFlatDocuments` report what
  changed between two PDFs word by word, with the page and rectangle of every difference;
  `ComparisonResult.SaveMarkup` writes a copy of either document in which insertions are
  highlighted, deletions struck out and removed text kept in the annotation note, so a reviewer
  reads the change list in any PDF viewer. Mirrors Aspose.PDF for .NET's `TextPdfComparer`.
- **AI copilots** — the `ai` subpackage adds document summarization (`SummaryCopilot`), OCR of
  scanned pages with a `MakeSearchable` pipeline that writes recognized text back as an invisible,
  selectable layer, document Q&A with conversation history (`ChatCopilot`), and automatic
  `/Alt` text generation for tagged figures (`ImageDescriptionCopilot`), over any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Text extraction, fonts, and optimization** — extract text in visual or raw reading order
  (`TextExtractOptions{Mode: TextExtractRaw}`) with full layout info, recover paragraph/column
  structure (`Paragraphs()`), search and replace text in place, embed and subset TrueType/
  OpenType fonts (`.ttf`/`.otf`/`.ttc`) — `Document.LoadFont`/`Document.LoadFontByName("Calibri",
  bold, italic)` resolve faces by family name via a pluggable `FontRepository`, and
  `Document.SubsetFonts()` rebuilds each embedded font's own glyph tables (`glyf`/`loca`/`hmtx`/
  `CIDToGIDMap`) down to only the glyphs actually used; custom glyphs can also be authored
  outright with `Document.CreateType3Font()` — `Type3Font.AddGlyph(rune, width)` hands back a
  drawing canvas in glyph space, so a symbol drawn with the vector API becomes a real font
  character whose text still extracts and searches (an embedded `ToUnicode` CMap carries the
  mapping); `Document.RemoveUnusedObjects()` deletes
  every object that neither a page nor the document catalog uses (metadata, bookmarks,
  attachments and the structure tree are kept) and returns the removed count on its own, or fold that
  same cleanup into a larger pass with the unified `Document.Optimize` pass
  (`DefaultOptimizationOptions()` is the safe, lossless preset — remove unused objects, subset
  fonts, Flate-compress and dedupe streams, pack objects into object streams; opt into lossy image recompression via
  `OptimizationOptions.Images`) or the image-only `Document.OptimizeImages(OptimizeImageOptions)`
  pass (max DPI downscaling, JPEG quality, and PNG→JPEG conversion); reduce file size further with
  `Document.SaveLinearized`/`WriteToLinearized` (linearized/fast-web-view output per ISO 32000-1
  Annex F, so viewers can render page 1 before the whole file downloads), or `ConvertToGrayscale`.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/aspose-pdf-foss/aspose-pdf-foss-for-go
```

Requires Go 1.24 or newer. The module has no transitive dependencies — everything is built on
the Go standard library, including the PDF parser/writer, the raster renderer, the SVG and
Markdown engines, and the PKCS#7/CMS signing code.

## Dependencies

### Required Package Dependencies

No required third-party package dependencies.

### Native and System Requirements

- Go 1.24 or later (`go.mod`'s own `go 1.24` directive).

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	pdf "github.com/aspose-pdf-foss/aspose-pdf-foss-for-go"
)

func main() {
	// Open a PDF and split it into per-page documents.
	doc, err := pdf.Open("input.pdf")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	pages, err := doc.Split()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	for i, p := range pages {
		p.Save(fmt.Sprintf("page%03d.pdf", i+1))
	}

	// Merge two PDFs into one — Append mutates the receiver in place.
	a, _ := pdf.Open("file1.pdf")
	b, _ := pdf.Open("file2.pdf")
	a.Append(b)
	fmt.Println("merged:", a.PageCount(), "pages")
	a.Save("merged.pdf")
}
```

See [`_examples/`](_examples/) for full runnable programs covering text, forms, annotations,
tables, vector graphics, SVG, and the end-to-end `feature_showcase` demo, or short focused API
snippets under "Examples" on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aspose-pdf-foss/aspose-pdf-foss-for-go).

## Feature Showcase

[![Feature showcase preview](docs/feature_showcase-preview.png)](docs/feature_showcase.pdf)

[**docs/feature_showcase.pdf**](docs/feature_showcase.pdf) is a single 14-page PDF generated by
[`_examples/feature_showcase`](_examples/feature_showcase/main.go) that walks nearly every
capability above in one document — a clickable table of contents (built with `Page.AddTOC`),
styled AcroForm fields, the full
annotation gallery, redactions, multi-page tables, vector graphics, and a meta "Rendering & Imposition"
page whose thumbnails are renders of the document itself, produced by this library's own renderer.
Cross-cutting metadata — bookmarks, named destinations, page labels, and Info + XMP
metadata — is set once and carried through the whole document. The showcase itself is
deliberately left unencrypted so it previews inline on GitHub and opens in every viewer;
encryption (RC4 / AES-128 / AES-256) is covered in
[Encryption and Signing](#encryption-and-signing) below. Regenerate it locally with
`go run ./_examples/feature_showcase`.

## Additional Examples

The most representative example beyond Quick Start is building a document from scratch with the
Flow layout engine — an additive layer over the Rectangle-based drawing API that computes the
rectangles for you — rather than editing an existing one.

### Content Authoring With the Flow Layout Engine

```go
doc := pdf.NewDocumentFromFormat(pdf.PageFormatA4)
flow := doc.NewFlow(pdf.FlowOptions{})
flow.AddHeading(1, "Quarterly Report", pdf.TextStyle{})
flow.AddParagraph("Revenue grew in every region this quarter.", pdf.TextStyle{Size: 11})
flow.AddList([]string{"North: +12%", "South: +8%"}, false, pdf.TextStyle{Size: 11})

pages, err := flow.Render()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("pages:", pages)
```

`NewFlow` returns a `*Flow` that lays chained `AddParagraph`/`AddHeading`/`AddImage`/`AddTable`/
`AddList` calls out top-to-bottom, paginating automatically; `Render()` returns the number of
pages produced. `FlowOptions.Tagged` auto-tags every element for a one-call PDF/UA-conformant
document.

### Encrypt a Document

```go
doc := pdf.NewDocumentFromFormat(pdf.PageFormatA4)
doc.SetEncryption(pdf.EncryptionOptions{
	UserPassword:  "secret",
	OwnerPassword: "owner-secret",
	Permissions:   &pdf.Permissions{AllowPrint: true, AllowCopy: true},
	Algorithm:     pdf.EncryptionAlgAES128,
})

var buf bytes.Buffer
if _, err := doc.WriteTo(&buf); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// The file is now encrypted; Open returns ErrEncrypted.
if _, err := pdf.OpenStream(&buf); err != nil {
	fmt.Println("encrypted")
}
```

### Digitally Sign and Verify

```go
key, _ := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), cryptorand.Reader)
tmpl := &x509.Certificate{
	SerialNumber: big.NewInt(1),
	Subject:      pkix.Name{CommonName: "Jane Signer"},
	NotBefore:    time.Now().Add(-time.Hour),
	NotAfter:     time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour),
	KeyUsage:     x509.KeyUsageDigitalSignature,
}
der, _ := x509.CreateCertificate(cryptorand.Reader, tmpl, tmpl, &key.PublicKey, key)
cert, _ := x509.ParseCertificate(der)

doc := pdf.NewDocumentFromFormat(pdf.PageFormatA4)
if err := doc.Sign(pdf.SignOptions{Certificate: cert, PrivateKey: key, Reason: "Approval"}); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
var buf bytes.Buffer
if _, err := doc.WriteTo(&buf); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

signed, _ := pdf.OpenStream(&buf)
sigs, err := signed.VerifySignatures()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("signatures: %d, valid: %v, reason: %s\n", len(sigs), sigs[0].Valid, sigs[0].Reason)
```

### Build a Table

```go
doc := pdf.NewDocument(595, 842)
page, _ := doc.Page(1)

table := pdf.NewTable().
    SetColumnWidths([]float64{120, 200, 80}).
    SetBorder(pdf.BorderInfo{Sides: pdf.BorderSideAll, Width: 1}).
    SetDefaultCellBorder(pdf.BorderInfo{Sides: pdf.BorderSideAll, Width: 0.5}).
    SetDefaultCellMargin(pdf.MarginInfo{Top: 4, Right: 6, Bottom: 4, Left: 6}).
    SetDefaultCellStyle(pdf.TextStyle{Font: pdf.FontHelvetica, Size: 10})

header := table.AddRow()
header.AddCells("Name", "Description", "Qty")
for _, c := range header.Cells() {
    c.SetBackground(&pdf.Color{R: 0.9, G: 0.9, B: 0.9, A: 1})
    c.SetHAlign(pdf.HAlignCenter)
}

row := table.AddRow()
row.AddCells("Widget", "Standard widget", "5")

pagesAdded, _ := page.AddTable(table, pdf.Rectangle{LLX: 50, LLY: 600, URX: 545, URY: 750})
fmt.Printf("table flowed to %d additional pages\n", pagesAdded)
doc.Save("table.pdf")
```

### Render a Page to an Image

```go
doc := pdf.NewDocumentFromFormat(pdf.PageFormatA4)
page, _ := doc.Page(1)
_ = page.AddText("Preview me", pdf.TextStyle{Size: 24},
	pdf.Rectangle{LLX: 50, LLY: 700, URX: 545, URY: 780})

img, err := doc.RenderImage(1, pdf.RenderOptions{DPI: 96})
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("rendered:", img.Bounds().Dx() > 0 && img.Bounds().Dy() > 0)
```

</details>

## API Reference

The public API lives in the single root package `asposepdf` (imported as `pdf`), centered on
`Document` — opened via `Open`/`OpenStream`/`OpenWithPassword`/`OpenStreamWithPassword` (the
stream forms take any `io.Reader`) and serialized via `Document.WriteTo` (implements
`io.WriterTo`, so it writes to any `io.Writer`); its `Pages()` method returns live `*Page` views,
and nearly every mutating method (rotation, reorder, metadata, passwords, …) modifies the
receiver in place; `Split` and `Extract` are the two exceptions, each returning a fresh, fully
independent `*Document`. AI copilots live in the separate `ai` subpackage so the root package
stays free of network code.

#### Detailed Member Reference

### Encryption and Signing

- `Permissions` fields map to ISO 32000-1 §7.6.3.2 Table 22 bits 3–12; the library encodes them
  with the Adobe convention (reserved bits set high). In `EncryptionOptions`, `Permissions` is a
  pointer so `nil` means "grant all", distinguishing that default from an explicit
  `&Permissions{}`, which denies everything.
- `EncryptionOptions.Recipients` switches to the public-key security handler (ISO 32000-1
  §7.6.4): the document is sealed for a list of X.509 certificates — each with optional
  per-recipient `Permissions`, which a password cannot express — and opened with
  `OpenWithCertificate`/`OpenStreamWithCertificate` by supplying the certificate and any
  `crypto.Decrypter` private key. AES-128 and AES-256 are supported (AES-256 by default); RSA
  recipients only, and the file re-saves for the same recipients after editing.
- `Document.Sign` covers the whole file with one PKCS#7-detached signature, invisible by default
  or visible via `Visible`/`Rect`/`Page`/`SignatureAppearance`; `PAdES` switches the subfilter to
  `ETSI.CAdES.detached`, `Certify` adds a DocMDP certification, and `TimestampURL` embeds an RFC
  3161 timestamp. Re-signing an already-signed document appends an incremental update so the
  earlier signature stays valid. `Document.VerifySignatures` returns `Valid`, `IntegrityOK`,
  `CoversWholeDocument`, and the signer `Certificate` per signature field — trust-chain validation
  against your own store is the caller's responsibility.

### Forms (AcroForm)

- `Form.AddBarcodeField(pageNum, rect, name, symbology, value)` draws a Code128 or QR barcode in
  place of text (`form.AddBarcodeField(1, rect, "sku", pdf.BarcodeQR, "https://example.com/sku/123")`);
  `(*BarcodeField).Symbology()`/`SetSymbology()` read/change the encoding, and `SetValue` validates
  the new value encodes under the current symbology before writing it. Both encoders are pure Go,
  with no external dependency.
- Field values containing non-ASCII characters are encoded as UTF-16BE with a BOM. `Form.Export/
  ImportJSON` round-trips every field as typed JSON keyed by full name (checkbox → bool, list box
  → array); `Form.Export/ImportFDF` and `Form.Export/ImportXFDF` provide the same round-trip in
  Acrobat-interoperable FDF and XFDF.
- Every widget's `/AP` appearance stream is pre-generated and regenerated on every value or style
  change, so fields render identically across Acrobat, Foxit, browser viewers, MuPDF, and Poppler
  without depending on `/AcroForm/NeedAppearances`.

### Outlines, Named Destinations, and Table of Contents

- `Document.Outlines()` is the root `OutlineItemCollection`; `NewOutlineItemCollection(doc)`
  constructs an unattached entry with an `IList`-equivalent surface (`Add`/`Insert`/`Remove`/
  `RemoveAt`/`At`/`Count`/`All`). All 8 destination types (XYZ/Fit/FitH/FitV/FitR/FitB/FitBH/
  FitBV) are supported; `Action` and `Destination` may both be set (viewers honor `/Dest` first).
- `Document.NamedDestinations()` reads both `/Catalog/Dests` (legacy) and `/Catalog/Names/Dests`
  (modern), writing modern-only with automatic migration on save.
- `Document.GenerateTOC` builds a clickable table of contents from the outline tree and inserts it
  as new page(s) at the front; `Page.AddTOC` renders a caller-supplied entry list into a
  rectangle, auto-paginating on overflow. `TOCOptions` controls the heading, per-level indent, and
  whether page numbers, dotted leaders, and links are drawn. A runnable example lives in
  [`_examples/toc`](_examples/toc).

### Attachments and Portfolios

- `Document.EmbeddedFiles()` manages document-level attachments through the
  `/Catalog/Names/EmbeddedFiles` name tree (ISO 32000-1 §7.11.4): `Add(path)`/
  `AddFromStream(name, r)` embed a file (MIME type detected from the extension), and each
  `*EmbeddedFile` exposes `Name()`, `Description()`/`SetDescription()`, `MIMEType()`, `Size()`,
  and `Data()`/`WriteTo(w)`/`Save(path)` to read it back. The page-pinned counterpart is
  `FileAttachmentAnnotation`.
- `Document.Collection()` presents those attachments as a **portfolio** (ISO 32000-1 §7.11.6 and
  §12.3.5): `SetView(CollectionViewDetails|Tiles|Hidden)` chooses the presentation mode,
  `Schema().Add(key, header, type)` declares the columns a viewer shows — text, number, and date
  columns carry per-file values, while `CollectionFieldFilename`/`Description`/`ModDate`/
  `CreationDate`/`Size` are derived from the attachment itself (`CollectionField.IsDerived()`) — and `SetInitialFile(name)` plus
  `SetSort(field, ascending)` control what opens first and how the list is ordered. Values are
  written per attachment with `EmbeddedFile.CollectionItem()`
  (`SetText`/`SetNumber`/`SetDate`, read back with `Text`/`Number`/`Date`). `IsPortfolio()`
  reports the state and `Remove()` reverts the document to a plain attachment list without
  touching the files. Folder hierarchies (`/Folders`) are out of scope.

### Document JavaScript and Open Actions

- `Document.JavaScript()` returns the document-level named-script collection, backed by the
  `/Catalog/Names/JavaScript` name tree (ISO 32000-1 §7.7.4 / §8.5.1) — `Add(name, script)`,
  `Get(name)`, `Has(name)`, `Remove(name)`, `Names()`, `Count()`, and `Clear()` manage it
  directly. This is distinct from the action-level `JavaScriptAction` that fires on an
  annotation click, not on the document-open event.
- `Document.OpenAction()`/`Document.SetOpenAction(act)`/`Document.RemoveOpenAction()` read, set,
  and clear the `/Catalog/OpenAction` entry (ISO 32000-1 §12.3.2 / §12.6.1) — the action a viewer
  runs when the document opens (GoTo, JavaScript, Named, …). A `GoTo` open action is bound to the
  document, so its destination resolves to a 1-based page number on read; both round-trip through
  `Save` and coexist with named destinations. Document-level JavaScript executes in the
  recipient's viewer when the file is opened — embed only scripts you authored or audited.

### Deleting Pages and Inserting Blank Pages

- `Document.DeletePages(pageNums ...int)` removes one or more 1-based pages in place — page
  numbers are de-duplicated and validated before anything is removed, so a call that would remove
  every page returns an error and leaves the document unchanged; `Document.DeletePage(n)` is the
  single-page convenience form.
- `Document.AddBlankPage(width, height)`/`Document.AddBlankPageFromFormat(format)` append a blank
  page to the end of an already-open document; `Document.InsertBlankPage(position, width,
  height)`/`Document.InsertBlankPageFromFormat(position, format)` insert one at a specific
  1-based position instead — distinct from building a whole new document from scratch via
  `NewFlow`.

### Text Drawing and Right-to-Left / Arabic Shaping

- `TextStyle.RTL` (or simply including RTL characters) enables right-to-left/bidirectional layout
  for drawn text: a pure-Go Unicode Bidi Algorithm (UAX #9) implementation reorders each line
  into visual order, keeping embedded numbers and Latin runs left-to-right, and RTL paragraphs
  right-align by default. Arabic contextual shaping (connected letterforms plus lam-alef
  ligatures via Presentation Forms-B) renders proper Arabic with any font that covers the block,
  including the bundled DejaVu Sans.
- Embedded OpenType fonts are shaped by their own GSUB/GPOS tables: a pure-Go shaping engine
  applies contextual forms, ligatures, kerning, and cursive and mark attachment the way HarfBuzz
  does, glyph for glyph, so Arabic, Persian, and Urdu join in fonts without Presentation Forms-B
  (Amiri, Noto Naskh Arabic), vowel marks sit on their base letters, and Latin text kerns. It
  needs no API change — `AddText` shapes automatically — and shaped text stays extractable and
  searchable through `ToUnicode` mappings and `ActualText` spans.
- `Document.CreateType3Font()` authors a Type3 font (ISO 32000-1 §9.6.5), whose glyphs are
  content streams rather than outlines: `AddGlyph(r, width)` returns a `*Page` canvas in glyph
  space (1000 units per em, baseline at `y = 0`) that accepts the whole drawing API, and the
  finished font drops into `TextStyle.Font` alongside Standard-14 and embedded faces. The font
  freezes on first use, embedding each glyph as a `/CharProcs` stream plus a generated
  `ToUnicode` CMap, so text drawn with custom symbols still extracts, searches, and renders.

### Vector Graphics and SVG Import

- `AddSVG`/`AddSVGFromStream` render a parsed SVG onto a page: basic shapes, the full SVG 1.1
  path syntax, transforms, `viewBox`/`preserveAspectRatio`, 147 CSS named colors, linear/radial
  gradients (`gradientUnits`/`gradientTransform`), `<text>`/`<tspan>` with font styling and a
  pluggable `SVGFontResolver` for non-Latin text, `<image>` (data URIs), `<defs>`/`<use>`/
  `<symbol>`, `<clipPath>` (clipping paths compile to PDF `W`/`W*` operators), `<mask>` (soft
  masks via a PDF Form XObject transparency group + ExtGState `/SMask`, honoring
  `maskUnits`/`maskContentUnits`), CSS `<style>` blocks, `<filter feDropShadow>`, and `<marker>`
  (`marker-start`/`marker-mid`/`marker-end` rotate via `orient=auto` along the path tangent, using
  `refX`/`refY` anchors). Unsupported and skipped silently: `<textPath>`, vertical writing
  modes, external `<image href>`, real Gaussian blur, and em/ex/% length units.

### Annotations

- `Page.Annotations()` returns the page's `AnnotationCollection`, with `Add`/`At`/`Delete`/
  `DeleteAt` managing the list directly.
- Supported subtypes: `Link` (with GoToURI/GoTo/Named/SubmitForm/ResetForm/JavaScript actions),
  `Highlight`, `Underline`, `StrikeOut`, `Squiggly`, `Square`, `Circle`, `Line`, `Ink`, `Text`,
  `FreeText` (Plain/Callout/Typewriter intents), `Stamp` (14 predefined visuals or a custom
  image), `Polygon`/`Polyline`, `Caret`, `FileAttachment`, and `Redact`. Existing form widgets
  surface as read-only `WidgetAnnotation`; mutate them through the `Form` API instead.
- `FileAttachmentAnnotation` shows one of four icons (`Paperclip` default, `Graph`, `PushPin`,
  `Tag`); the embedded file's MIME type is auto-detected from its extension.
- Border styles (`Solid`/`Dashed`/`Beveled`/`Inset`/`Underline`) and 10 line-ending shapes are
  available on the drawing types; every property setter immediately regenerates the annotation's
  `/AP/N` appearance stream, so no `/NeedAppearances` flag is needed.
- `Document.ApplyRedactions()` removes text glyphs, image XObjects, and paths inside a
  `Redact` annotation's `/QuadPoints`; `ValidateRedactions()` is a recommended pre-flight
  parseability check. `NewJavaScriptAction` carries a documented security warning — embedded
  JavaScript executes in the recipient's viewer.

### Stamps

- `TextStamp`, `ImageStamp`, `PageNumberStamp`, and `PdfPageStamp` (which stamps in a page from
  another PDF) overlay or underlay content via `(*Page/*Document).AddStamp`, with `Opacity`,
  centre-pivot `RotateAngle`, alignment, and a `Background` behind-content flag;
  `PageNumberStamp.Format` uses `{0}`/`{1}` placeholders for the page number and total (e.g.
  `"Page {0} of {1}"`).

### Validation: Structural, PDF/A, and PDF/UA

- `Validate` is a structural-integrity check only (`INVALID_HEADER`/`XREF_ERROR`/`OBJECT_ERROR`/
  `PAGE_TREE_ERROR`/`STREAM_ERROR`/`ENCRYPTED` issue codes) — not a PDF/A or PDF/UA conformance
  check.
- `ValidatePDFA(PDFA1B/2B/3B/1A/2A/3A)` inspects the XMP `pdfaid` identifier, font embedding,
  encryption, JavaScript/Launch actions, the ICC OutputIntent against device colour, transparency
  (PDF/A-1), annotation flags, and metadata compression; the "a" levels additionally require a
  Tagged PDF (structure tree + `/Lang`).
- `ConvertToPDFA` strips encryption and JavaScript, removes embedded files for PDF/A-1, sets
  annotation print flags and draws the appearances annotations are missing, embeds the fonts the
  document actually draws with — Standard-14 and other simple fonts through bundled
  metric-compatible clones, composite (CJK) fonts as a subset of the matching installed face, and
  Symbol or ZapfDingbats from a face registered through `AddFontFile`/`AddFontFolder` — adds a
  pure-Go sRGB ICC OutputIntent, and writes a `pdfaid` XMP packet, then returns a report of
  whatever still fails. Across a 1,000-document corpus, 97% convert to a clean report; confirm
  full conformance with a dedicated validator such as veraPDF. `ConvertToPDFA` does not flatten
  transparency (a `TRANSPARENCY` finding for PDF/A-1 stays unresolved) — call
  `Document.FlattenTransparency()` separately first: it rasterizes only the pages that actually
  use a transparency group, soft mask, non-Normal blend mode, or alpha < 1, leaving every other
  page fully vector.
- `ValidatePDFUA` checks the PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1) prerequisites: a Tagged PDF with
  `/StructTreeRoot` + `/ParentTree`, a declared `/Lang`, a displayed title, alternate text on
  every figure/formula, and accessibility not blocked by encryption.

### Tagged PDF Authoring

- `AddTaggedTable` renders a `Table` and builds its `/Table → /TR → /TH`/`/TD` structure in one
  call (repeating header rows become `/TH`); `AddTaggedList` does the same for bulleted/numbered
  lists. Decoration (headers, footers, page numbers) is marked as an artifact so it stays out of
  the structure tree.

### Rendering to Images

- The renderer draws vector graphics (paths, Gray/RGB/CMYK/Separation/DeviceN colour, shadings,
  tiling patterns, clipping, alpha, soft masks, blend modes), images (Image XObjects, stencil
  masks, CCITT Group 3/4 fax, JBIG2 bilevel scans, JPEG2000 colour scans including MRC
  stencil-masked layers), and text (embedded TrueType/CFF/Type3, non-embedded fonts via bundled
  metric-compatible substitutes, non-embedded CJK via predefined Adobe CMaps rendered from
  installed system fonts), and annotation appearances (AcroForm field widgets, stamps,
  highlights, free text, …) to PNG/JPEG/GIF/BMP/TIFF at a default 150 DPI over the CropBox.
  Unsupported elements (mesh shadings, isolated/knockout transparency groups, non-embedded
  Symbol) are skipped so a page always renders. Embedded fonts render via `/FontFile3` (CFF/
  Type1C and CID-keyed) and TrueType tables; non-embedded fonts resolve through a `FontRepository`
  covering exact/installed fonts including `.ttc` collections and `.otf`/CFF; JPEG2000 colour
  scans (`/JPXDecode`) are decoded including MRC high-resolution stencil-masked foreground layers.

### HTML, SVG, and Markdown Conversion

- `SaveHTML`/`WriteHTML` export one single-file HTML document with no external assets and no
  JavaScript; text is selectable and Ctrl+F-searchable in every mode, link annotations become
  clickable `<a>` overlays, and `InteractiveForms` turns AcroForm fields into real browser
  controls.
- `SaveSVG`/`WriteSVG` export standalone true-vector SVG with real Bézier paths, native strokes,
  and glyph-outline text (no font dependencies); `SVGSaveOptions.DPI` (default 150) sets the
  resolution of the small raster patches used only where shadings/patterns/soft masks can't be
  expressed in SVG.
- `MarkdownToDocument`/`FromStream` render headings, styled bold/italic/code/link runs, task
  checkboxes, block quotes, code cards, and GFM tables into a paginated PDF; `MarkdownOptions.
  FontFamily`/`CodeFontFamily` (or explicit `LoadFont` faces) cover non-Latin text. `SaveMarkdown`/
  `WriteMarkdown` reverse the process, inferring headings from font size and recovering
  bold/italic/code runs, links, and nested lists — tables are not yet reconstructed and flow as
  paragraphs.

### AI Copilots

- `ai.NewSummaryCopilot` produces plain-text or, with `ai.SummaryOptions.Markdown` set,
  Markdown-rendered document summaries — the model is asked to format the summary as Markdown,
  which is then rendered through the same `MarkdownToDocument` pipeline used elsewhere;
  `ai.NewOcrCopilot` recognizes scanned pages (auto-detected by low extractable text plus a
  dominant full-page image) and its `MakeSearchable` method writes the recognized text back as an
  invisible, selectable layer; `ai.NewChatCopilot` answers questions about a document with
  conversation history; `ai.NewImageDescriptionCopilot.FillAltTexts` fills missing `/Alt` text on
  a tagged document's figures. All four work over any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, LiteLLM,
  Ollama, …) and are implemented with the standard library only.

### Text Extraction, Search, and Images

- `SearchText` (literal, case-insensitive, or RE2 regex, with an optional region) returns
  per-match bounding boxes built from per-glyph positions; `ReplaceText` redraws the replacement
  at the same baseline/size/colour in a metric-compatible Standard-14 face. Both match within a
  single text line only.
- `Document.ExtractImages()`/`Page.ExtractImages()` decode every image on all pages (or one page)
  as JPEG (DCTDecode passthrough) or PNG, across DeviceRGB/DeviceGray/DeviceCMYK/Indexed/ICCBased
  color spaces with soft masks applied as PNG alpha; `Document.ImageInfos()`/`Page.ImageInfos()`
  list the same images' position, size, and color space *without* decoding pixel data, for fast,
  selective extraction (call `.Extract()` on just the ones you need). `AddImage`/
  `AddImageFromStream` (a file path or an `io.Reader`, respectively; an Image XObject either way)
  is the recommended default for anything larger than a tiny icon, where `AddInlineImage` is more
  appropriate.
- `ImageToDocument(path, opts...)`/`ImageToDocumentFromStream(r, opts...)` build a brand-new
  single-page `*Document` from a standalone JPEG or PNG file, with `ImageToDocumentOptions`
  controlling explicit `PageWidth`/`PageHeight` and margins (0 = size the page from the image's
  own DPI). An already-placed page image can be swapped in place with `ImageInfo.Replace(path)`/
  `.ReplaceFromStream(r)` (format auto-detected from magic bytes; position and size on the page
  stay unchanged even if the new image's own dimensions differ) or removed entirely with
  `ImageInfo.Remove()` (deletes the XObject reference and its drawing operators from the page;
  page-level images only, not ones nested inside a Form XObject).

## Scope and Limitations

- Viewer permissions (`Permissions`/`SetPermissions`) are enforced by PDF viewers, not by this
  library — the encryption bitfield is written into the file, but the library itself is not a
  DRM mechanism.
- Linearization (`SaveLinearized`/`WriteToLinearized`) cannot be combined with encryption or
  digital signing in the same document.
- Certificate-based encryption accepts RSA recipients only (PKCS#1 v1.5 key transport); elliptic
  curve recipients (key agreement) and the legacy RC4 sub-filters are not written.
- OpenType shaping covers Arabic-family, Hebrew, and simple (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) scripts; the
  Indic, Khmer, Myanmar, and Hangul reordering shapers and vertical text are not implemented.
- `ConvertToPDFA` embeds a font only when a face is available to it: Symbol and ZapfDingbats need
  one registered through `AddFontFile`/`AddFontFolder` (no metric-compatible clone is bundled),
  and a composite font needs the matching face installed. It does not flatten transparency itself
  (call `Document.FlattenTransparency()` before converting to PDF/A-1) or draw appearances for
  icon annotations (sticky notes, file attachments), and a font whose licensing bits forbid
  embedding is left alone. Confirm full conformance with a dedicated validator such as veraPDF.
- `FlattenTransparency` only looks at a page's content stream and `/Resources` graph; an
  annotation's own opacity or the transparency inside its `/AP` appearance stream is untouched —
  flatten annotations into page content first (`Annotation.Flatten()`/`Form.Flatten()`) if that
  also needs to go. It also only rasterizes whole pages, not just the transparent region within
  one, so a flattened page's text is no longer extractable.
- The built-in renderer does not support mesh shadings (PDF shading types 4-7); other shading
  types, patterns, and blend modes render normally.
- `ConvertToGrayscale` maps device colours, images, and shadings/patterns to their luminance grey
  in place, but Separation/DeviceN, Indexed, and PostScript/sampled shading functions are
  best-effort only.
- `MarkdownToDocument` has no syntax highlighting yet; `SaveMarkdown` does not reconstruct tables
  from a PDF (cell text flows as paragraphs) and caps inferred heading levels at 3.
- `SearchText` and `ReplaceText` match within a single text line only — a query that straddles a
  line break is not found.
- Scanned pages are auto-detected (no extractable text plus a dominant full-page image);
  `OcrOptions.Pages`/`All` override the default selection when auto-detection guesses wrong. The
  bundled `LLMOCREngine` returns line-level OCR text with no coordinates, so
  `MakeSearchable` positions the hidden searchable text on an even grid rather than exact
  per-word boxes; implement the one-method `ai.OCREngine` interface over an engine that reports
  word boxes (e.g. Tesseract or a cloud OCR service) for exact alignment. For non-Latin text,
  pass a Unicode font via `OcrOptions.Font` (see `Document.LoadFont`).
- The AI copilots (summarization, OCR, chat, alt-text) send extracted document text and/or
  rendered page images to the configured endpoint. For sensitive documents, point the client at a
  local endpoint (e.g. Ollama) — the same client code works unchanged.
- `Table` does not yet support content-driven auto-fit column widths, per-side border dash
  patterns, or a `RowSpan` group splitting across a page break.

These limitations don't apply to
[Aspose.PDF for Go — Enterprise Edition](https://products.aspose.com/pdf/go-cpp/), which adds
the full Aspose.PDF facade surface, broader format coverage, and commercial support.

## Development and Testing

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Standalone runnable example programs live in `_examples/<name>/main.go` (excluded from
`go build ./...`/`go test ./...` by their leading underscore); run one directly with
`go run ./_examples/<name>`. Short, focused API examples live as `ExampleXxx` functions in
`examples_test.go`, validated by `go test` via their `// Output:` comments and surfaced on
pkg.go.dev next to each documented function. Test PDF fixtures live flat under `testdata/`.

## Third-Party Notices

The compiled library links against nothing but the Go standard library, and every PDF primitive
— the parser, writer, raster renderer, SVG and Markdown engines, and the PKCS#7/CMS signing code
— is implemented from scratch within the module. It bundles Latin-subset copies of four
metric-compatible open fonts (Arimo, Tinos, Cousine, and Carlito), used to render the PDF
Standard-14 fonts and Calibri when no embedded or system font is available, licensed under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1 — see [fonts/LICENSE.txt](fonts/LICENSE.txt).
